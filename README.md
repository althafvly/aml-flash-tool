# Amlogic flash tool

This is the flash-tool for Amlogic platforms.

----------------------------

This is the flash-tool for Amlogic platforms.
This flash-tool script rely on update linux tool that need firstly to be installed.
Please read the file tools/_install_/README before to proceed here.

## Installation

This flash-tool script rely on update linux tool that need firstly to be installed.
Please run

```bash
./INSTALL
```

 to install dependency and usb rules.

After than you can call flash-tool.sh from anywhere, it will give you quick help :

```bash
Usage      : ./flash-tool.sh --img=/path/to/aml_upgrade_package.img> --parts=<all|none|bootloader|dtb|logo|recovery|boot|system|..> [--wipe] [--reset=<y|n>] [--soc=<m8|axg|gxl|txlx|g12a>] [efuse-file=/path/to/file/location] [bootloader|dtb|logo|boot|...-file=/path/to/file/partition] [--password=/path/to/password.bin]
Version    : 4.9
Parameters : --img        => Specify location path to aml_upgrade_package.img
             --parts      => Specify which partition to burn
             --wipe       => Destroy all partitions
             --reset      => Force reset mode at the end of the burning
             --soc        => Force soc type (gxl=S905/S912,axg=A113,txlx=T962,g12a=S905X2,m8=S805/A111)
             --efuse-file => Force efuse OTP burn, use this option carefully
             --*-file     => Force overload of partition files
             --password   => Unlock usb mode using password file provid
             --destroy    => Erase the bootloader and reset the board
```

Before to enter in the details here, let's explain how the connection work with the Amlogic board.

First you neeed to connect the board to your linux pc with a usb cable.
It can be done using a cable (USB Type A to USB Type A) or (USB Type A to USB Micro-B 5 pin).
It depends how the board has been designed actually.

The port to be used on the board is also dependant of the hardware. But you have to know that one particular USB 
port will be configured in slave mode at boot stage in two cases :

1/ No valid boot image can be found to boot on it, the Soc goes directly in usb boot mode
2/ USB boot mode forced in current u-boot flashed with the 'update' command.

When the Soc is in USB mode, if you have installed properly the update binary tool, your linux machine
should detect a new usb device called /dev/worldcup

By calling dmesg, you should see something like :

```bash
[19519.971862] usb 3-3.2: USB disconnect, device number 28
[40055.121229] usb 3-3.2: new high-speed USB device number 29 using xhci_hcd
[40055.212495] usb 3-3.2: New USB device found, idVendor=1b8e, idProduct=c003
[40055.212498] usb 3-3.2: New USB device strings: Mfr=0, Product=0, SerialNumber=0
```

And you will see a Amlogic usb device when you execute lsusb command.

```bash
$ lsusb
Bus 001 Device 052: ID 1b8e:c003 Amlogic, Inc. USB DEVICE
```

It's important to see this before to proceed on the next step, otherwise it will not work.

If all is here, it means you are now ready to flash the board or/and to control it from your PC machine

If you have already built android tree or linux tree, you can directly flash you new images by doing this : 

```bash
$ flash-tool.sh --img=/path/to/aml_upgrade_package.img --parts=all --wipe --soc=gxl
```

Also sometimes, it could be nice to update only some partitions but not all of them.
It can be done using the --parts parameter. For example here, we just reflash the system android partition with :

```bash
$ flash-tool.sh --img=/path/to/aml_upgrade_package.img --parts=system --soc=axg
```

You can also burn the efuse in the same way with :

```bash
$ flash-tool.sh --img=/path/to/aml_upgrade_package.img \
                --parts=all \
                --wipe \
                --soc=gxl \
                --efuse-file=/path/to/output/pattern.efuse.uboot
```

If you want to replace a specific partition from the image, you can overload it by doing this :

```bash
$ flash-tool.sh --img=/path/to/aml_upgrade_package.img \
                --parts=all \
                --wipe \
                --soc=gxl \
                --system-file=/path/to/my/system.img
```

It will flash all elements that are part of the aml_upgrade_package.img except the system.img that will be 
the one you specified. The same mechanism is working for all partitions names [boot-file,bootloader-file,dtb-file,....]

Enjoy!
